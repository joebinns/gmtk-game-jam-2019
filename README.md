# Bloomerang

The garden is swarming with angry bees! Luckily, you've got your trusty 'Bloomerang' to help ward them off. Be careful though, you only get one shot to take enemies out. If you miss, the Bloomerang won't come back, and you may be finished!

Bloomerang is a procedural top-down roguelike.

The game was conceptualised and made in 48 hours for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam (GMTK) 2019. The theme of the jam was 'only one'.
